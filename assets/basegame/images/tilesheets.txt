========== How to create a tilesheet ==========
Tilesheets are basically just a large image containing sprites used on tiles in the game. The game will look at the image and a simple json file to figure out how it should use the tilesheet in any level its used in.
There are example tileset images in this folder with the names
- `alt_tiles.png`
- `auto_tiles.png`
- `empty_tiles.png`
- `full_tiles.png`

the json file should be formatted like this

{
    "type": "full",
    "tiles": {
        "source": "full_tiles.png", 
        "width": 16,
        "height": 16
    }
}

type is the type of tileset this is. here are the possible values:
-  full: a full tilesheet, with every possible "connection" state.
- empty: a basic tilesheet with only a filled state
